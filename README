HUD Tenant can help you calculate your tenant rent if you are a HUD Tenant or an applicant. It is useful for people in Low Rent or Section 8 Housing programs. If you are a tenant already you can use it before or after you go to the housing authority to get another contract. If you are an applicant you would know the rent once you get admitted into the programs.

Our main goal is give to a tenant or to an applicant the ability of having on his/her hands the program so they can review as much as they need.

The app can run offline so you don't need to be connected to internet in order to use it.

The idea is not to ask all the tedious questions a Housing Authority would do in order to be precise but only a few questions even though we might get slightly different results. Most of the times, our calculations would be enough for realizing if you would be accepted, based on your income, to be part of the low rent or section 8 programs.

We are also providing all Housing Authority information publicly available in HUD Website so you can call, email or browse their information if available.

Additionally, we included the Fair Market Rent for 2014 so you can know the rent that HUD thinks is fair by state and county.

The app uses Sencha Touch but also PhoneGap to do the native part so functionality like navigate is not going to work if you use Chrome or Safari.
